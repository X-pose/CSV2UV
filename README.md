# CSV2UV - Utility Software for Converting CSV files from DCS into UV maps.

SV2UV converts DCS ModelViewer2 exported CSV UV data (the UV to file export) directly into image UV maps so you can create liveries without using Blender. 

This project is based on and inspired by Ettenmure’s [dcs-uv-converter](https://github.com/Ettenmure/dcs-uv-converter/) (which used a Blender add-on). You must attribute Ettenmure for the original approach; CSV2UV reimplements and extends that idea in C# .NET Core and adds features you need.
